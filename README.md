- Organising code by refactoring procedural functions into methods
- **Data validation** with user input and exception handling
- Handling **CSV persistence** and edge cases (no file, empty data)
- Creating clear **docstrings** and **inline comments** for maintainability
- Generating professional **data visualisations**
